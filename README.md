# Quick Scalfolding Project for both API and Single Page Application

## Initiative

There was one of my project requires API interfaces for integration across systems and browser based administration at the same time. The "Swagger" with its specification and tools came to my mind firstly for its intensive defining and crafting of API in structual but readalbe 'YAML' document.

As I investigated the official solution in project ['swagger-node'|https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node], the 'API first' development method looks really atracting and promising. So I did some search and came up with such stack:

* [swagger-node|https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node]
  As project skeleton for its builtin swagger editor and API-hosting server based on Express. So the development of API is prepared and able to begin right away. Modifying API and testing the HTTP request at the same time is really on a good pace.
